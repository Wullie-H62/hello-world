I have returned to the programming world after a long absense.
Some 40 years ago I began learning about how computers worked and became proficient in the use of machine code to get them to perform functions and routines.
When the WEB was born I dabbled with HTML and basic web page building for fun and even learned how to use Adobe Flash.

Late in 2018 I found a desire to create a Microsoft Access database. Having been proficient in this some 15 years or so ago, I decided to brush up and learn what has changed in the version I had been using then and what was available now.

To my surprise I found that Microsoft no longer supports Access and just had to ask the question....

What do we do now..................

So began my current journey, 

I began by studying Microsoft Entity Framework & ASP.net MVC but then came to the opinion that I wanted to learn a framework that could be applied to other systems like Android and IOS.

After some confusing research into what is out there I settled on using Angular and have been working through an on-line tutorial hosted my Mosh Hamedani. Mosh's teaching method is very conducive to my learning needs.

Whilst working through the tutorial I have broken off to brush up on Java, HTML and Typescript

I have no current desire to become a professional web designer but have developed an almost compulsive need to create a datbase app using Angular. 
This is proving to be extremely difficult as the current version of Angular is vastly different to the one used in the tutorial and a lot of the techniques that are taught in the tutorial do not function...
Researching issues is also proving difficult, partly I believe due to not knowing how to ask the question correctly when something dosen't work.

Troubleshooting consequently is proving to be extremely difficult at present, but i am nothing if not persistent.....
